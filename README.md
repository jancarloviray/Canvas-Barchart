Simple Canvas Barchart
----------------------
I made this as I was trying to learn HTML5 Canvas. It's simple, to-the-point barchart. It auto-resizes based on amount of data, and canvas height and width. At its current state, it's usable, but not yet polished.

TODO
----
- clean, organize and modularize code
- allow usages of options: title, legend, backgroundColor, font, fontSize, gridColor, etc...
- adjust height of bars to autoresize on canvas height.
- add Screenshot
- Organize files to BarChartJS.js, and make index example file.
